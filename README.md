# WeRateDogs Twitter Data Wrangling & Analysis

This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that posts and rates pictures of dogs. These ratings have numerators that are greater than the denominators. 
In this analysis, I focused on wrangling WeRateDogs's Twitter archive data. Some of the Twitter data has been provided by Udacity, as well as details on each dog 
such as the name, rating, and stage (whether the dog is a doggo, floofer, pupper, or puppo). However, not all of the desired data is present in Udacity's dataset, 
so I also use the Twitter API to gather additional data.

In the analysis, I aim to answer the following questions, the question are subdivided into insights and visualization:

**Insights:**
Most common device used to tweet

Dog with highest and lowest number of ratings

Most common dog

**Visualization:**

Is there Correlation between ratings and favourite counts

Trends of tweets by month

Trends of retweets by month

Trends of favourited tweets by month
